# Using Machine Learning Regression Algorithms to Predict House Prices in Vietnam

This repository contains the code and resources for a comprehensive study on house price prediction in Vietnam using machine learning techniques. The study aims to develop an accurate and reliable framework for predicting house prices, leveraging a diverse dataset sourced from alonhadat.com.vn and supplemented with data from Wikipedia.
## Abstract
Accurate house price prediction is crucial for stakeholders in the real estate market, yet it remains challenging due to the market's inherent complexity and dynamism. This study addresses this issue by developing a comprehensive machine learning framework for house price prediction in Vietnam. We leverage a robust dataset of 28,156 property listings, sourced from alonhadat.com.vn and supplemented with data from Wikipedia. Through rigorous data preprocessing, feature engineering, and a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, including CatBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest, we identify the most effective techniques for predicting house prices.
The results demonstrate the superiority of ensemble methods, with CatBoost achieving the highest performance on the main dataset (RÂ² = 0.510, RMSE = 17.614). Regional analyses in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City reveal the adaptability of the models to local market dynamics, with XGBoost and Random Forest exhibiting the best performance, respectively. Furthermore, we employ SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to uncover the key drivers of house prices, such as area, population density, and property-specific attributes.
The findings not only contribute to the academic understanding of real estate valuation but also provide actionable insights for policymakers, investors, and other stakeholders. This study lays the groundwork for the development of automated valuation models (AVMs) and their practical implementation, exemplified by a web application (https://hathang-housepricceprediction.hf.space/). By harnessing the power of machine learning and data-driven insights, this research paves the way for more transparent, efficient, and informed decision-making in Vietnam's real estate sector.
